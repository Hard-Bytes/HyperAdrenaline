# HyperAdrenaline by HardBytes
[ABPCE20] Proyecto de Videojuegos del grupo HardBytes del ABP 2020/21

## About our project
**HyperAdrenaline** is a project made by students of the 4th year of Multimedia Engineering at **University of Alicante** (Spain)[1] in the academic year of 2020-2021.
We made a First Person Shooter (FPS) game for **Linux Manjaro** (version Nibia 10.2)[2], made with our own Render, Audio and Game engine.
There is also a release for Windows. Check our year's page for downloads[4].

We're are using FMOD[3] as our audio engine and HyperEngine as our graphics engine. The HyperEngine was developed by us.
Irrlicht[5] was used as a temporary engine while we learned and developed our own engine.


## Compiling
Once you have this repository cloned or its contents downloaded in your Manjaro machine, just run:
```
make
```
Now run the game app with:
```
./HyperAdrenaline
```
Once you have done that, the game will start. Enjoy!

## Downloads
You can play the game without compiling. Check out the downloads in the University of Alicante's page [4].
